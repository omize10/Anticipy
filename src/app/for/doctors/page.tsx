    question: "Can I wear Anticipy during patient consultations?",
    answer:
      "No. Anticipy is not HIPAA-compliant and should not be worn during patient encounters. Any audio processing of conversations that include Protected Health Information (PHI) would require a Business Associate Agreement and HIPAA-compliant data handling, which Anticipy does not currently provide. Anticipy is designed for use outside clinical settings: break rooms, personal calls, administrative meetings, and personal errands.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Anticipy store any health-related data?",
    answer:
      "Anticipy does not store audio, transcripts, or recordings. It processes audio in real-time to detect actionable tasks, then discards the audio. The only data retained is the task description and its outcome. If you use Anticipy to schedule your own dentist appointment, for example, the system retains that a dentist appointment was booked, not the conversation that led to it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Could Anticipy eventually become HIPAA-compliant?",
    answer:
      "HIPAA compliance for an ambient audio processing system would require significant changes to Anticipy's data handling architecture, including encryption, access controls, audit logging, and a Business Associate Agreement framework. This is not on the current product roadmap. The scenarios on this page are specifically limited to non-clinical, non-PHI contexts.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the pendant noticeable under scrubs or a white coat?",
    answer:
      "Anticipy is an 8-gram brushed titanium pendant on a chain. It can be worn under scrubs or a white coat and is not visible when tucked under a collar. However, it should be removed before entering clinical areas where patient conversations occur.",

            Anticipy is an AI wearable pendant that listens to your conversations and completes tasks
            you mention. For doctors, the relevant use cases are strictly outside the clinical
            setting. Anticipy is not a medical tool and does not handle patient data. What it does is
            catch the personal and administrative tasks that doctors accumulate during break room
            conversations, calls with colleagues about non-patient matters, personal phone calls, and
            the everyday logistics of a life that is chronically short on time.

            Physicians work long, unpredictable hours. Personal tasks pile up because there is no
            natural break in the day to handle them. You mention needing to reschedule your dentist
            appointment while walking to the parking garage. You tell a colleague you want to sign up
            for a dermatology conference while grabbing coffee. You remind yourself to cancel a
            subscription while eating lunch. These are the tasks Anticipy catches and completes. The
            pendant goes on when you leave the clinical area and handles the rest of your life.

            The Physician&apos;s Time Problem

          <p className="text-[17px] text-[var(--text-on-dark-muted)] font-light leading-[1.8] mb-6">
            Doctors work some of the most unpredictable schedules in any profession. A planned lunch
            break becomes an emergency. An evening off becomes an on-call shift. The personal tasks
            that most people handle during downtime have no reliable window in a physician&apos;s day.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-[var(--text-on-dark-muted)] font-light leading-[1.8] mb-6">
            The result is a growing backlog of personal and administrative tasks: dentist appointments
            that get pushed for months, CME credits that get handled at the last minute, subscriptions
            that keep charging long after they stopped being useful, and personal logistics that fall
            entirely to a spouse or partner because the doctor simply has no time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-[var(--text-on-dark-muted)] font-light leading-[1.8] mb-6">
            Anticipy does not add time to your day. It eliminates the need for time in the first place.
            When you mention a task in conversation, it gets done. You do not need to find a free
            fifteen minutes to sit down, open a browser, and navigate a website. The task moves from
            &quot;mentioned&quot; to &quot;completed&quot; without any dedicated time investment from you.
          </p>

            HIPAA and Clinical Boundaries
          </h2>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-[var(--text-on-dark-muted)] font-light leading-[1.8] mb-6">
            Anticipy processes audio through a cloud-based pipeline. Any conversation involving
            Protected Health Information (PHI) processed through this pipeline would constitute
            unauthorized PHI disclosure under HIPAA regulations. Anticipy does not have a Business
            Associate Agreement (BAA), does not maintain HIPAA-compliant data handling procedures, and
            is not designed for clinical use.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-[var(--text-on-dark-muted)] font-light leading-[1.8] mb-6">
            This means Anticipy must be removed before entering clinical areas where patient
            conversations occur. The recommended workflow is straightforward: wear the pendant during
            your commute, during breaks in non-clinical areas, and during personal time. Remove it
            before entering exam rooms, patient floors, or any area where PHI may be discussed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[17px] text-[var(--text-on-dark-muted)] font-light leading-[1.8] mb-6">
            At 8 grams, the pendant is easy to put on and take off. Since Anticipy processes each
            conversation independently with no accumulated context, removing it for clinical hours has
            no impact on its functionality during other parts of the day. The pendant you put back on
            at 5 PM works just as well as if you had worn it all day.
