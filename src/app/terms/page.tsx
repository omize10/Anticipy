                  A wearable hardware device equipped with a microphone array and Bluetooth Low Energy
                  (BLE) connectivity. The pendant captures ambient audio in your environment and

                  performs on-device processing (including transcription and intent extraction), manages
                  device settings and preferences, and communicates with the cloud action engine.

                If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by
                a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be modified to
                the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable, or if
                modification is not possible, severed from these Terms. The invalidity or

                of the remaining provisions, which shall continue in full force and effect.
